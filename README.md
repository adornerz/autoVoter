# autoVoter
Auto voter script for a minecraft server on topminecraftservers.org with protonvpn IPs


This is a simple python script which votes for our minecraft server with every Protonvpn free servers, adding 16 votes everyday
It's build using selenium, and I don't know if it will work on windows (if "protonvpn-cli c -xx" command works on cmd than it will).
Yeah that was it, don't expect an 100% clean code I put this up in 10 mins.
Aight bye and vote for the minecaft server, the link is inside the code.
